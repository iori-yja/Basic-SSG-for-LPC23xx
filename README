discription:
I wrote this mainly for my use.
So, Comments are often in Japanese, and perhaps there're waste routines for other purpose.
If you're in trouble, ask me.

Usage:
ymzwrite(long|byte)(Data,address) in main.c is entity.
ymzwritelong is for writing tone(0:2)

drv.c is PLL driver, it has no use for driving for SSG.
